# discordbot
first i created a boiler plate to work on adding features 
1.registered a bot on discord developers site
2.using pycharm worked on three main files main.py bot.py and responses.py
3.at first responses were just limited to already set parameters
4.bot.py was connected to the fact of responding on private or in the server to the user
5.with the discord bot token in hand i was able to run a small test which worked 
6.Now to add open ai api i had to read the documentation required which lead to me to the chat feature and the openai library in python 
7.with that i added a single setcase to test the chat function using gpt-3 in discord
8.Now the work of adding reminders
